Beyond is an informative site for users to learn about the planets in our solar system. It fetches up-to-date information including average temperature, surface gravity, and number of moons from Le Systeme Solaire's API. Beyond is built using HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript.

This project allowed me to practice fetching JSON data from an API and formatting/displaying them on the DOM. I also implemented a simple dropdown menu and an image slider to familiarize myself with those techniques.
